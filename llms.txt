# NpsychBatteryNorms

NpsychBatteryNorms lets you easily calculate normative scores for a wide
variety of neuropsychological tests using various methods.

## Installation

``` r
# Install remotes if not already installed
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rmtrane/NpsychBatteryNorms")
```

## Simple Usage

The main function in this package is `std_scores` which lets us
standardize raw scores. As an example, we can standardize a raw score
for the MoCA of 21 for a 57 year old male patient with 15 years of
education using normative data published by NACC:

``` r
library(NpsychBatteryNorms)

std_scores(
  raw_scores = 21,
  var_name = "MOCATOTS",
  sex = "m",
  age = 57,
  education = 15,
  method = "norms",
  version = "nacc"
)
```

``` R
[1] -2.192308
```
