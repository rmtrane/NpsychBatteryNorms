# Means and Standard Deviations

For most variables, we include means and standard deviations stratified
by groups of age, education, and sex.

Notes on data sources, etc.:

- `nacc` versions are obtained from the tables published on the [NACC
  data
  website](https://naccdata.org/data-collection/forms-documentation/uds-3)
  (direct link to pdf
  [here](https://files.alz.washington.edu/documentation/uds3-means.pdf)).
  These were created using the data release of September 2020.

- `updated` versions are meant to be direct updates to the `nacc`
  versions. They are found using the data release of June 2024.

- `ravlt_trials` versions are only available for a small subset of
  variables. The source of these numbers are unknown, but these have
  been used in clinic for some time, and are therefore included here for
  backwards compatibility.

In [Table 1](#tbl-means-and-sds), you can filter the variables and
versions to see the means and standard deviations for all variables
available.

Table 1: Groupwise means and standard deviations for variables. Note:
the columns ‘Years of Education’ and ‘Sex’ are empy for some
combinations of variable and version. This happens when the given
combination does not adjust for these variables.
