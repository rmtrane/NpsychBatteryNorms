\description{
Calculates the Functional Assessment Score summary (FAS) from the ten scores of
\itemize{
\item bills
\item taxes
\item shopping
\item games
\item stove
\item meal prep
\item events
\item paying attention
\item remembering appointments
\item travel
}

Each score is on the scale 0 (Normal), 1 (Has difficulty, but does by self),
2 (Requires assistance), 3 (dependent). Further, error codes of 8 (Not
applicable, e.g. never did) and 9 (Unknown) are also allowed, while -4
indicates data not collected. The FAS is calculated as the sum of the ten
scores where any 8s or 9s are counted as 0.
