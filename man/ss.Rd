gives the scaled score for the variable \code{var_name} corresponding to a
raw score of \code{raw_score}.

\section{Scaled Scores}{
Scaled scores are used in the calculation of T-scores. In short, the T-scores
are based on a regression model that fits the scaled scores as a function of
sex, age, and years of education (with some second order terms). The purpose
of the scaled scores is to force the data to be more normal looking. For more
details, see \insertRef{karstensMayoNormativeStudies2023}{NpsychBatteryNorms}.
