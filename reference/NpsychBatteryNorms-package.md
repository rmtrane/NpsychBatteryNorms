# NpsychBatteryNorms: Calculate Normative Score for Neuropsychological Test Scores

This package implements a number of different methods for standardizing
neuropsychological test scores. Most methods are implementations of
previously published models. This package is designed to work nicely
with the Shiny application included in the R package
NpsychAssessmentTools, which can be used to visually represent test
scores.
