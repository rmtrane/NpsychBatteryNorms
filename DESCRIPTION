Title: Calculate Normative Score for Neuropsychological Test Scores
Version: 0.1.0
Description: This package implements a number of different methods for 
    standardizing neuropsychological test scores. Most methods are implementations
    of previously published models. This package is designed to work nicely with
    the Shiny application included in the R package NpsychAssessmentTools, which
    can be used to visually represent test scores.
